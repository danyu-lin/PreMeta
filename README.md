# **PreMeta**

PreMeta is a software program written in C++ that is designed to facilitate the exchange of information between four software packages for meta-analysis of rare-variant associations: MASS, RAREMETAL, MetaSKAT, and seqMeta. PreMeta has two related purposes: one is to allow the use of different software packages within the same consortium; and the second is to eliminate the need to recalculate summary statistics when investigators join a new consortium that has adopted a different software package.
